0.2.1.1

	* Tightened the version bounds for data-default. The old bounds weren't
	accurate.

0.2.1.0

	* Added searchBugs' and searchBugsWithLimit', variations which return
	only a list of BugIds. These are more suitable for polling than the
	existing functions.

0.2.0.0

	* History events now have a sequential id, just like comments.

	* When using an anonymous session, Bugzilla does not return email
	addresses for users.  To accomodate this, the User type now stores email
	addresses as type 'Maybe UserEmail'.
